To use, simply place an Adapter on any power storage and connect to the computer. 
Currently supports IC2, GregTech, Thermal Expansion, Immersive Engineering, Applied Energistics and Zetta Industries*.
For AE, connect your adapter to the ME Controller. Power is listed seperately as it's not "usable", and is hiden if no ME is installed.
Hit Enter at any time to queue a program end. This may take a few seconds depending on network size.

*Zetta has a Computer port and does not need an Adapter.
